# Generative-Models-for-Abstract-Art
This bachelorâ€™s thesis proposes a Deep Learning model system with the goal of generating
high-resolution abstract art. For this, a corpus of approximately 37,000 abstract art
images was created by merging several already existing datasets such as WikiArt and
Delaunay. We continued by analyzing images and removing similarities or duplicates,
studying generative models (Generative Adversarial Networks, Variational Autoencoders,
Denoising Diffusion Models), focusing on more recent models: Diffusion Models, Vector
Quantized Variational Autoencoders.
