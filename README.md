# Generative-Models-for-Abstract-Art
Bachelor's thesis introduces a Deep Learning model for high-resolution abstract art generation. Utilizes a merged dataset of 37,000 images from sources like WikiArt. Explores modern generative models, including Diffusion Models and Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders, GANs and more.
